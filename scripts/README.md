# Evaluation Scripts

To evalute the performance of your tool, follow these steps:

## 1. Replace the original design files

Replace original .def and .v files with the modified versions generated by your tool.

Update the file paths in:
```
ISPD26-Contest/scripts/{design_name}/design_setup.tcl
```


## 2. Run the evaluation script

```
cd ISPD26-Contest/scripts/{design_name}
source eval.sh
```

## 3. Check the results
After the evaluation completes, the following output files will be generated:
```
ISPD26-Contest/scripts/{design_name}/{folder_name}/evaluation.log

ISPD26-Contest/scripts/{design_name}/{folder_name}/metrics.csv
```
- evaluation.log – detailed log of the evaluation process.

- metrics.csv – performance metrics reported by OpenROAD’s timing and power analysis infrastructure.
